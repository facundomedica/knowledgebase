<main>
<p>This is my process to figure out what&rsquo;s wrong with pretty much anything (not that I can figure out everything, but it&rsquo;s my go-to process to everything). It&rsquo;s language agnostic and what I suppose you can call &ldquo;fast paced&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s specially useful when debugging code bases I don&rsquo;t know, given that I can&rsquo;t assume anything, just follow the code and see where it leads me to. But as always, YMMV.</p>
<h3 id="1-search-for-keywords-find-out-whats-the-dependency-that-holds-your-attributes-of-interest">1. Search for keywords, find out what&rsquo;s the dependency that holds your attributes of interest.</h3>
<p>Main tools:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>cmd/ctrl + click</code> to follow where things come from</li>
<li>Search bars. I use my IDE&rsquo;s, Github and Google to find the origin of anything</li>
</ul>
<p>The process is simple, if you don&rsquo;t know where something is defined you just search it everywhere you can until you see a meaningful result. If you already know where something is coming from, then start going around doing cmd+click at stuff.</p>
<h3 id="2-log-log-log">2. Log log log</h3>
<p>Use <code>fmt</code> or <code>log</code> packages (or any other log package available in the code you are debugging) to print:</p>
<ul>
<li>Objects and attributes that could be remotely related to the issue</li>
<li>Interest points (I tend to write a lot of <code>HEREEEEEE!!!: 1</code>, <code>HEREEEEEE!!!: 2</code>, etc)</li>
<li>Anything that is mildly interesting ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-reduce-search-area-clean-and-repeat">3. Reduce search area, clean and repeat</h3>
<p>Once you are pretty sure that something is not related to the issue, you can remove those log statements.</p>
<p>For example, if you see in the command line <code>HERE!: 1</code> and <code>HERE!: 2</code>, but not <code>HERE!: 3</code> then you are 100% that something&rsquo;s failing between log 2 and 3.</p>
<p>You can now <code>cmd+click</code> whatever is there and start over from step 1.</p>
<h2 id="why-not-use-the-debugger">Why not use the debugger?</h2>
<p>I tend to use the debugger when:</p>
<ul>
<li>I need to gain insights into something that I&rsquo;m already familiar with</li>
<li>I got the issue narrowed down to a small portion of the code and still can&rsquo;t figure it out</li>
<li>The code it&rsquo;s linear and doesn&rsquo;t involve any threads/goroutines</li>
<li>The code being debugged doesn&rsquo;t span across multiple dependencies</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>If the debugger is a sniper rifle then my process above is a machine gun. With the sniper rifle you know who your target is, while with the machine gun we are just shooting in the dark hoping to hit something.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Counter Strike analogy aside, my process = broad debug, debugger = narrow debug.</p>
<p>Also in Go&rsquo;s case, it&rsquo;s faster to write log statements and re-run the code than to wait for the debugger to initialize every time you make a change (or maybe I have a shitty computer).</p>
