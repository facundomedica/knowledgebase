<p>A week ago I noticed that our Android builds were failing in the pipeline, the logs stated that it failed to download a couple of dependencies from JCenter with 502s, so I thought <em>&ldquo;no worries, I&rsquo;ll just re-run the pipeline and it&rsquo;ll get fixed!&rdquo;</em> <strong>Nope!</strong> The JCenter server was down for a while, so I decided to do some googleing and found out that JFrog had deprecated Bintray and JCenter <a href="https://blog.gradle.org/jcenter-shutdown">earlier this year</a>.</p>
<p>After a while everything was back to normal, but it was clear we had to stop using JCenter and use mavenCentral. This should have been an easy change, but it wasn&rsquo;t. <strong>The main dependency in our app is a closed source library that is exclusively published on JCenter by a trusted (<em>but with bad dev support</em>) third-party</strong>. So we couldn&rsquo;t just pull it from Github and use it as a submodule or something like that, we had to use a different approach.</p>
<p>Of course we count on the publisher to migrate to mavenCentral some time in the future, but in the meantime we&rsquo;ll have this plan B ready to deploy whenever things go south (which for a service that&rsquo;s getting deprecated might be more often than usual).</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl"> mkdir localmaven <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="nb">cd</span> localmaven

<h4 id="add-your-local-maven-repo-to-your-buildgradle">Add your local maven repo to your build.gradle</h4>
<p>Under <code>allprojects</code> -&gt; <code>repositories</code> add the following (in the last position):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span class="line"><span class="cl">        maven { url rootProject.rootDir.getAbsolutePath() + &#34;/localmaven&#34; }
</span></span></code></pre></div><h3 id="step-3">Step 3</h3>
<h4 id="remove-jcenter-optional">Remove jcenter (optional)</h4>
<p>Given that the libraries on JCenter won&rsquo;t receive any more updates, you can safely remove it from your build.gradle once you&rsquo;ve made a copy of all the required dependencies.</p>
